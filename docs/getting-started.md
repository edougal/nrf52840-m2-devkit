# Getting Started with the nRF52840 M.2 Developer Kit

## Introduction
This guide describes how to run the Out of Box Demo without going through the complete toolchain installation. After following along with this section, you’ll be ready to start building your IoT projects.

## Included in the Box

Your nRF52840 M.2 Developer Kit box includes:

|    **Part**                | **Qty** |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| nRF52840 M.2 Module        | 1       |
| M.2 Dock                   | 1       |
| 2.4 GHz Cabled PCB Antenna | 1       |

## Assemble the hardware

1. Make sure the M.2 Dock is powered off

2. Attach the provided 2.4GHz and NFC cabled PCB antennas to the nRF52840 M.2 module as shown in the figure below:

	![Attach Antennas]()

3. Insert the module into the connector as shown in the figure below:

	!!! Warning "Angle of Insertion"
		Angled insertion is allowable and preferred to minimize the insertion force. The angle of insertion is **5° ~ 25°**, **typically 20°**.

4. Secure the module using the provided mounting screw as shown in the figure below:

	!!! Warning
		DO NOT put too much force on the mounting screw (into the M.2 connector stand-off) so that the PCB is bent. Bending the PCB too much will damage the module!
