## Overview

The [Zephyr OS](https://zephyrproject.org/) is a scalable real-time operating system (RTOS) supporting multiple hardware architectures, optimized for resource constrained devices, and built with security in mind.

Zephyr OS is open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/LICENSE) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).
