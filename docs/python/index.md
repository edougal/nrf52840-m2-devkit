# Python on Microcontroller

To run Python code on this microcontroller, we need MicroPython or its variant CircuitPython.

[MicroPython](http://micropython.org/)

>MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

[CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/)

>CircuitPython is a beginner friendly, open source version of Python for tiny, inexpensive computers called microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are the brains of many electronics including a wide variety of development boards used to build hobby projects and prototypes. CircuitPython in electronics is one of the best ways to learn to code because it connects code to reality. Simply install CircuitPython on a supported board via drag and drop and then edit a code.py file on the CIRCUITPY drive. The code will automatically reload.

## Overview
The nRF52840 M.2 devkit is CircuitPython-compatible and supports most of CircuitPython drivers.
We are going to use a firmware based on CircuitPython to run Python code here.

## Getting Started
We think the best way to learn is by doing. And to help you get started, we have provided a series of tutorials. Find the details below:

* [Install Python on Microcontroller](install.md)
* [Blinky](examples/blinky.md)
* [More Samples and Demos](examples/index.md)s
